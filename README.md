# Transfer Object Assembler Pattern (DTO) Demo
Code used in the presentation/live coding demo "Transfer Object Assembler Pattern (DTO) in Frontend with TypeScript and Zod". 

Benefits of using the assembler pattern:
- Avoid tight coupling between your app and third parties (e.g. external APIs).
- Centralize DTO-mapping logic.
- Improve legibility and maintainability of your code.
- Prevent hard to find/predict bugs.
